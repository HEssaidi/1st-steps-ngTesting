### FirstStepNgTest
My first steps into Angular testing using Karma/Jasmine
### Jasmine
[Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) is a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code that plays very well with Karma. Similar to Karma, it's also the recommended testing framework within the Angular documentation as it's setup for you with the Angular CLI. Jasmine is also dependency free and doesn't require a DOM.

#### beforeEach
is executed before each unit test; It will only be executed before each it() call.
we have other test cases like afterEach/beforeAll/afterAll !
